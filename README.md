# Relation_Networks-pytorch
Relation Networks for object detection based pytorch

### Progress

- [x] train and forward resnet based faster-rcnn on VOC2012
- [x] add pyramid module
- [x] add relation module
- [x] add nms using relation module
- [ ] train end to end faster-rcnn on VOC2012
- [ ] train and forward on COCO
